    <h1>Privacy Policy for NZ Sliding Puzzles: Canterbury</h1>
    <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 2026</div>

    <p>
      NZ Sliding Puzzles: Canterbury is an offline sliding puzzle game inspired by real
      walks and locations across the Canterbury region of New Zealand.
      This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      NZ Sliding Puzzles: Canterbury does not collect, store, transmit, or share
      personal or sensitive user data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app does not require account creation, login, or submission of personal
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Game progress, unlocked artwork, avatars, rewards, and user preferences
      are stored locally on the user's device only.
      No data is uploaded to external servers or cloud services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uninstalling the app may permanently remove locally stored progress data.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The app offers an optional one-time purchase to unlock additional content.
      All payments are processed securely through Google Play Billing.
    </p>
    <p>
      NZ Sliding Puzzles: Canterbury does not collect, store, or have access
      to payment or financial information. Payment processing is handled
      independently by Google Play under their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The app relies on Google Play services for billing and distribution.
      Google may process limited technical information (such as device identifiers)
      as required for app functionality. This processing is governed by
      Google’s own Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      NZ Sliding Puzzles: Canterbury does not independently access,
      store, or control this information.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Content</h2>
    <p>
      The app includes an optional sharing feature that allows users to share
      completed artwork using other applications installed on their device.
      This action is initiated by the user and occurs locally on the device.
      The app does not track, log, or store shared content.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      Optional local notifications may be used to enhance the gameplay experience.
      Notification data is processed locally and is not transmitted externally.
      Users may disable notifications at any time through device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      NZ Sliding Puzzles: Canterbury is intended for a general audience.
      Because the app operates offline and without user accounts,
      no personal information is knowingly collected from children or adults.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      The app is distributed globally via Google Play.
      As no personal data is collected or processed by the developer,
      user privacy rights under applicable laws (including GDPR)
      are respected by design.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
      Any changes will be reflected by updating the Effective Date above.
